# Release evidence

Raw JUnit/Allure reports live under `build/` (gitignored, regenerated per run), so this file is
the durable record of what a specific release/tag was verified against.

## automation-foundation-v1.0

- **Date:** 2026-08-25
- **Target:** local Docker Compose SUT (`./gradlew.bat localSutUp && ./gradlew.bat localSutHealth`), `baseUrl=http://localhost`
- **Commands:** `./gradlew.bat localTest`, then `./gradlew.bat stabilityTest -PstabilityRuns=10`
- **Result:** 27/27 tests passed on every one of 10 consecutive `stabilityTest` iterations (0 failures, 0 errors each run) — counts aggregated from the per-run JUnit XML under `build/stability-results/run-{1..10}/test-results/`:

  | Run | Tests | Failures | Errors |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | 27 | 0 | 0 |
  | 2 | 27 | 0 | 0 |
  | 3 | 27 | 0 | 0 |
  | 4 | 27 | 0 | 0 |
  | 5 | 27 | 0 | 0 |
  | 6 | 27 | 0 | 0 |
  | 7 | 27 | 0 | 0 |
  | 8 | 27 | 0 | 0 |
  | 9 | 27 | 0 | 0 |
  | 10 | 27 | 0 | 0 |

- **Also green at this point:** `./gradlew.bat spotlessCheck test` (default read-only suite, 20 tests including the `TestConfigTest` mutation-guard unit tests added for this release).

This table is hand-verified from artifacts already on disk, not re-run at doc-writing time (Docker wasn't up in that session) — regenerate with the commands above to reproduce, or before cutting the next tag.

## runner-dashboard-v1.0 (Faza 9: CI for the runner/dashboard vertical slice)

- **Date:** 2026-09-02
- **Scope:** `runner-service` (Spring Boot SSE test runner) + `runner-dashboard` (React/Vite frontend) + `dashboardE2eTest` (real-browser Playwright E2E across both), and the two new CI workflows that gate them: `dashboard-quality.yml` (frontend quality gate + backend/frontend OpenAPI contract) and `dashboard-e2e.yml` (real-browser dashboard E2E), on top of the existing `quality-gate.yml`/`local-sut.yml`.

### Frontend test suite + coverage

- **Command:** `npm run check` (in `runner-dashboard/`) — format, lint, import boundaries, TypeScript, `vitest run --coverage`, production build.
- **Result:** 118/118 tests passed across 17 test files. Coverage (v8 provider, gated at 80/75/80/80 statements/branches/functions/lines):

  | Metric | Result |
  |---|---|
  | Statements | 95.91% (329/343) |
  | Branches | 90.03% (253/281) |
  | Functions | 95.53% (107/112) |
  | Lines | 96.42% (324/336) |

  JUnit XML written to `runner-dashboard/test-results/junit.xml` (added specifically so CI has a machine-readable report to upload on failure, alongside the coverage directory).

### OpenAPI contract

- **Command:** `npm run api:check:snapshot` (no live backend) and, separately, `npm run api:check:contract` against a real locally-started `runner-service` (`java -jar runner-service/build/libs/runner-service-*.jar`, health-polled at `/actuator/health`).
- **Result:** both green — the committed `openapi/runner-api.json` snapshot, the generated typed client, and the live backend's `/v3/api-docs` all agree; `git status` stayed clean after regenerating from the live backend.

### Dashboard E2E (`dashboardE2eTest`)

- **Command:** `./gradlew.bat dashboardE2eTest` (one command — depends on `:runner-service:bootJar` and `dashboardBuild` automatically).
- **Result:** 7/7 scenarios passed in 1m51s: run lifecycle, 404 run, download log, strict Cancel (reaches `CANCELLED`), SSE gap-replay, native-reconnect, backend-unavailable/recovery. Zero orphaned `java`/`node` processes left behind afterward (checked via `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process`), zero files under `build/dashboard-e2e-failures/` (nothing failed).
- **Real E2E vs. controlled SSE-transport tests — important distinction:** 5 of the 7 scenarios (run lifecycle, 404, download log, Cancel, backend-unavailable/recovery) are genuine end-to-end tests — a real `runner-service` process, a real `runner-dashboard` production build served via `vite preview`, driven by a real headless Chromium, with no network mocking. The other 2 (gap-replay, native-reconnect) are honestly labeled, in their own test-class Javadoc, as **browser-level SSE transport/recovery integration tests**: they use Playwright's network-routing interception to simulate a dropped/gapped SSE connection against the real backend, which is the only practical way to exercise that recovery path deterministically — not a claim that the backend itself was ever actually killed mid-stream for those two (that scenario is what the isolated `BackendUnavailableE2eTest` actually does).

### Phase 8 polish closed out

- `cancelActiveRunIfAny`'s interrupted-wait path now throws (instead of returning silently) so `safely()` logs an incomplete cleanup instead of hiding it.
- `BackendUnavailableE2eTest` now gets the same screenshot/trace/video-on-failure evidence as every other dashboard-e2e test, via a new shared `BrowserFailureArtifacts` helper (extracted from `DashboardE2eEnvironment`, which now calls the same helper).
- `dashboardBuild`/`dashboardE2eTest` are now documented in the root `README.md` (prerequisites, one-command invocation, the 7 scenarios, and exactly where reports/logs/failure artifacts land).

### GitHub Actions — status

The Gradle/npm-level commands above were run and verified locally (this machine). **Not yet done**, and required before this phase can be called fully closed:

- [ ] A real `workflow_dispatch` run of `dashboard-quality.yml` on GitHub's `ubuntu-latest` runner (both jobs: `frontend-quality` and `openapi-contract`).
- [ ] A real `workflow_dispatch` run of `dashboard-e2e.yml` on GitHub's `ubuntu-latest` runner, confirming Linux-specific behavior (Chromium + system deps install via `playwrightInstall -PwithDeps=true`, `npm ci`, the two backend processes binding their ports) that this Windows dev machine cannot verify.
- [ ] A deliberate, temporary break-and-revert (one assertion, or a throwaway branch) to prove the failure-artifact upload paths in both workflows actually produce the expected files.
- [ ] Run IDs/links for the above, once available, recorded here.

This environment cannot push to `origin` or trigger `workflow_dispatch` (no `gh` CLI, no push credentials) — see the project's own notes on this constraint. These four items need to be run and confirmed by hand, from the Actions tab, before `runner-dashboard-v1.0` is a complete sign-off rather than a locally-verified one.
